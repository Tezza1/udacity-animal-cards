            <p>Emerald dragons are known to be temperamental, stingy and vindictive. They hoard precious stones with a penchant for diamonds and emeralds. Their favored method of attack is using their toenails to cut into their prey. Male dragons tend to relax on snowy mountain peaks for large period of time watching the Mongol sports festivals. Whilst females tend to spend their time prowling the mountains caves for new emeralds.</p>
